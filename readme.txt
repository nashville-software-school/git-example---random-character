1. create git repo
2. create HTML, referencing styles and script. add those files
3. commit and push. then another dev can add styles in a separate branch while...
4. first dev adds script in a new branch. set an array of character classes, log a random one
5. after committing, then merging both of those branches dev 2 can add character races in a new branch.
6. both developers want to add an extra class to the end of the array. and one removes a race.
7. PR for each of these branches. conflict on second one. pull down and resolve locally, then PR again.
